★ReadFi: Turning Reflections into Rewards
ReadFi is a Read-to-Earn protocol on Solana that rewards emotional and intellectual engagement with books.
Users earn $READ (for insight) and $LOL (for humor) simply by sharing reflections and reacting to others — all via a fast, expressive, and low-cost interface powered by Solana.

● What It Does
Reflect: Post book takes with emotion and personality

React: Use emoji to vote on reflections that made you feel something

Earn: Authors receive $READ/$LOL tokens via smart contracts triggered by community response

Grow: Level up via participation and access DAO privileges

● Tech Stack
Blockchain: Solana (Anchor, SPL Tokens)

Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Storage (future): Arweave or IPFS

Ecosystem: Backpack (xNFT badge display), Dialect (notifs), Drip (Zine drops)

● Core Features
Dual-token model:

$READ = Depth, resonance, thoughtful content

$LOL = Wit, charisma, community-driven engagement

Emoji-based micro-transactions

DAO-governed book clubs and curated Zines

Participatory literary NFTs & tokenized book publishing

Proof of Emotion > Proof of Stake

● Why Solana?
High-speed: Instant reaction = instant reward

Low-cost: Sustainable for frequent micro-interactions

Integration-friendly: Backpack xNFTs, Drip drops, DAO tooling

Cultural fit: Solana is fast, expressive, and weird — just like ReadFi

● Monetization Strategy
Token-gated content (Zines, annotated editions, co-created books)

DAO membership tiers and community publishing vaults

Educational integrations (reflections = course credits or credentials)

Affiliate-driven book links and long-tail reading incentives

● Vision
We imagine a world where reflection and reading are rewarded — not just liked.
ReadFi is building a cultural protocol where books are alive, ideas evolve through DAO participation, and literary value accrues onchain.

Because reading was always the original DAO. We just gave it a token and a UI.

● Hackathon Roadmap (MVP)
