ReadFi: Turn Emotion Into Yield

🧠 Vision
To create a global cultural economy where intellectual engagement, empathy, and literary exploration are not only valued — but rewarded.
As a career editor and journalist who has spent years shaping bestsellers, I’ve seen firsthand how the publishing industry is in decline. I started building ReadFi not only to keep the act of reading alive in a Web3 world — but because I believe it’s fundamentally compatible with crypto: reading is a compounding investment in knowledge, just like yield is in DeFi.
In the long term, we envision a world where 'read, share, and earn' is second nature — where ReadFi is to Web3 what Kindle was to eBooks. As antitrust cracks widen around Amazon, we see a future where ReadFi could collaborate directly with digital book platforms to reshape global reading habits.
📈 Market Opportunity
The global book market is valued at over $120 billion, with over 1 billion readers globally using digital or hybrid platforms. ReadFi targets three intersecting audiences:
Web3-native users seeking culturally relevant, reward-based apps
Digital readers and amateur reviewers underserved by Web2 platforms
Education partners exploring decentralized assessment tools
This overlap opens new space for user-generated knowledge economies that reward emotional and intellectual effort — not just clicks.
🗣️ Early Validation
The product is pre-launch, but concept validation is ongoing. We are engaging with Web3 builders, literary influencers, and educators to refine positioning and build early interest in ReadFi DAOs.
ReadFi: Because reading was always the original DAO.
