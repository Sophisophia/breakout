â˜…ReadFi: Turning Reflections into Rewards
ReadFi is a Read-to-Earn protocol on Solana that rewards emotional and intellectual engagement with books.
Users earn $READ (for insight) and $LOL (for humor) simply by sharing reflections and reacting to others â€” all via a fast, expressive, and low-cost interface powered by Solana.

â–  What It Does
Reflect: Post book takes with emotion and personality

React: Use emoji to vote on reflections that made you feel something

Earn: Authors receive $READ/$LOL tokens via smart contracts triggered by community response

Grow: Level up via participation and access DAO privileges

â–  Tech Stack
Blockchain: Solana (Anchor, SPL Tokens)

Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS

Storage (future): Arweave or IPFS

Ecosystem: Backpack (xNFT badge display), Dialect (notifs), Drip (Zine drops)

â–  Core Features
Dual-token model:

$READ = Depth, resonance, thoughtful content

$LOL = Wit, charisma, community-driven engagement

Emoji-based micro-transactions

DAO-governed book clubs and curated Zines

Participatory literary NFTs & tokenized book publishing

Proof of Emotion > Proof of Stake

â–  Tokenomics & Smart Contract Logic

We use a dual-token incentive system powered by emotional reactions:

- ðŸ˜‚ = $LOL (humor)
- ðŸ§  = $READ (insight)
- ðŸ˜¢ = $READ (emotional impact)

Each reaction updates the authorâ€™s score in a daily reward pool. Users can only react once per post to avoid farming. Rewards are distributed algorithmically based on aggregate scores.

ðŸ§  Emoji-to-Token Weighting

| Emoji | Token | Weight |
|-------|--------|--------|
| ðŸ˜‚     | $LOL   | +1     |
| ðŸ§      | $READ  | +1.5   |
| ðŸ˜¢     | $READ  | +1     |

â–  Smart Contract Highlights

- Reflections are hashed and timestamped on submission
- Emoji reactions are logged and verified for uniqueness
- Scores are aggregated on a rolling 24h epoch
- Tokens are distributed proportionally from a reward pool
- Events trigger UI updates (e.g., badge progress, Zine eligibility)

This creates an incentive loop based on authenticity, not volume:  
*Proof of Emotion > Proof of Stake*

â–  Why Solana?
High-speed: Instant reaction = instant reward

Low-cost: Sustainable for frequent micro-interactions

Integration-friendly: Backpack xNFTs, Drip drops, DAO tooling

Cultural fit: Solana is fast, expressive, and weird â€” just like ReadFi

â–  Monetization Strategy
Token-gated content (Zines, annotated editions, co-created books)

DAO membership tiers and community publishing vaults

Educational integrations (reflections = course credits or credentials)

Affiliate-driven book links and long-tail reading incentives

â–  Vision
We imagine a world where reflection and reading are rewarded â€” not just liked.
ReadFi is building a cultural protocol where books are alive, ideas evolve through DAO participation, and literary value accrues onchain.

Because reading was always the original DAO. We just gave it a token and a UI.
